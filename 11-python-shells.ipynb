Ipython will now show all the possible commands (and variable names) that start with <span>`ra`</span>. If you type a third letter, here <span>`n`</span> and press “Tab” again, Ipython will auto complete and append <span>`ge`</span> automatically.\n",

This is not the case with the <span>`run`</span> command in ipython (and neither when executing chunks of Python code from Emacs using the Emacs Python mode). In particular this can be very useful if one needs to setup a few objects which are needed to test the code one is working on. Using ipython’s <span>`run`</span> or Emacs instead of IDLE allows to keep these objects in the interpreter session and to only update the function/classes/... etc that are being developed.\n",

See <http://pythonhosted.org/spyder/> for more.\n",
