    "-   floating point numbers and integers used in numeric computation are generally quite different from “mathematical numbers” (symbolic calculations are exact and use the “mathematical numbers”):\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   there is a maximum number and a minimum number that can be represented (for both integers and floating point numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   within this range, not every floating point number can be represented in the computer.\n",

    "-   We deal with this limitation by:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   never comparing two floating point numbers for equality (instead we compute the absolute value of the difference)\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   use of algorithms that are *stable* (this means that small deviations from correct numbers can be corrected by the algorithm. We have not yet shown any such examples this document.)\n",
