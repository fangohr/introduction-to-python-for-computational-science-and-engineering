An [Introduction to Python for Computational Science and
Engineering](https://github.com/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/blob/review-readme-2018-09-08/Readme.md), developed by Hans Fangohr (2003-2020).

The content and methods taught are intended for a target audience of
scientists and engineers who need to use computational methods and
data processing in their work, but typically have no prior programming
experience or formal computer science training.

The book is available
- [pdf](https://github.com/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/raw/master/pdf/Introduction-to-Python-for-Computational-Science-and-Engineering.pdf) ([version](pdf/version.txt))
- interactively [as Jupyter Notebooks on MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/library-current-versions?filepath=index.ipynb); probably the most attractive version of the book as any code examples can be executed and modified immediately to explore the language and improve one's understanding.
  ([Use JupyterLab](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/library-current-versions?urlpath=lab/tree/index.ipynb) instead of the traditional Notebook.)

  or [in this zip file in the docs folder](https://github.com/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/archive/master.zip)) ([version](docs/version.txt))
- downloadable Jupyter Notebook files (`*.ipynb`) ([in this zip file](https://github.com/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/archive/master.zip))
- [most recent sources and materials on Github (this page)](https://github.com/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/blob/review-readme-2018-09-08/Readme.md)



The book is based on Python 3.

(A Python 2.7 version
is
[available online](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~fangohr/training/python/pdfs/Python2-for-Computational-Science-and-Engineering.pdf))

# Translation

# Favour request and citation

If you are using the book (be it as a teacher in your lecture course,
as a student to support your learning, or in any other role), please
send a short message to hans.fangohr@xfel.eu . Ideally, this would
contain at which university/institution/company you are and how you
use the book (in one sentence). This kind of data is useful to support
further maintenance and extensions of the materials.
