An Introduction to Python for Computational Science and Engineering, developed
by Hans Fangohr (2003-2021).

The content and methods taught are intended for a target audience of scientists
and engineers who need to use computational methods and data processing in their
work, but typically have no prior programming experience or formal computer
science training.

The book is available:

- [As a web page (html)](https://fangohr.github.io/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/)

<!-- TODO: Enable this AFTER first merge and deploy to master! -->
- [As a PDF](https://fangohr.github.io/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/book.pdf)
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->
- Interactively [as Jupyter Notebooks on MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/master?urlpath=tree/book/index.ipynb) (or [use JupyterLab](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/master?urlpath=lab/tree/book/index.ipynb) instead of the traditional Notebook.)

The book is based on Python 3.

(A Python 2.7 version is [available
online](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/~fangohr/training/python/pdfs/Python2-for-Computational-Science-and-Engineering.pdf))

# Why use this book? (Feedback from user)

> *Readers looking for a beginner's guide to Python are faced with a
> bafflingarray of choices. However, Introduction to Python for Computational
> Science and Engineering, by Hans Fangohr is uniquely valuable because it is
> specifically aimed at those of us who are engaged in applied science or
> scientific research. The book is concise, well organized and full of practical
> examples that the reader can implement as they are going along. The key
> concepts of programming are introduced in the first half of the book, while
> the second half focuses on science/engineering applications: numerical
> methods, optimization, scientific plotting, and data science. This book is a
> must-have companion for anyone learning to use Python to enable their work in
> applied science or scientific research."
