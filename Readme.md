An introduction to Python for Computational Science and
Engineering, developed by Hans Fangohr (2003-2018).

The book is available
- [pdf](https://github.com/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/raw/master/pdf/Introduction-to-Python-for-Computational-Science-and-Engineering.pdf) ([version](pdf/version.txt))
- interactively [as Jupyter Notebooks on MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/master?filepath=index.ipynb); probably the most attractive version of the book as any code examples can be executed and modified immediately to explore the language and improve one's understanding.
  ([Use JupyterLab](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/master?urlpath=lab/tree/index.ipynb) instead of the traditional Notebook.)
- html ([online](https://fangohr.github.io/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/)
  or [in this zip file in the docs folder](https://github.com/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/archive/master.zip)) ([version](docs/version.txt))
- downloadable Jupyter Notebook files (`*.ipynb`) ([in this zip file](https://github.com/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/archive/master.zip))



The book is based on Python 3.

(A Python 2.7 version
is
[available online](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~fangohr/training/python/pdfs/Python2-for-Computational-Science-and-Engineering.pdf))

# Translation

# Favour request and citation

If you are using the book (be it as a teacher in your lecture course,
to support your work, or as student to support your learning), please
send a short message to hans.fangohr@xfel.eu . Ideally, this would
contain at which university/institution/company you are and how you
use the book (in one sentence). This kind of data is useful to support
further maintenance and extensions of the materials.
