* Overall strategy: separate Docker containers for development and mybinder

This repository uses a Dockerfile in the root directory for development
purposes. This includes translation of the source files (in book/*ipynb) to html
and pdf (using jupyterbook), which in turns needs a full latex installation.

That makes the container quite big.

For myBinder, we do not need latex, so in this directory, we attempt to have a
leaner definition of dependencies.

Binder should look in this directory (as it is called 'binder') and ignore the
global Dockerfile.
