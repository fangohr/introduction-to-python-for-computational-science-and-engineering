    "The submodule `matplotlib.pyplot` provides an object oriented interface to the plotting library. Many of the examples in the matplotlib documentation follow the import convention to import `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` and `numpy` as `np`. It is of the user’s decision whether to import the `numpy` library under the name `np` (as often done in matplotlib examples) or `N` as occasionally done in this text (and in the early days when the predecessor of numpy was called “Numeric”) or any other name you like. Similarly, it is a matter of taste whether the plotting submodule (`matplotlib.pyplot`) is imported as `plt` as is done in the matplotlib documentation or `plot` (which could be argued is slightly clearer) etc.\n",
