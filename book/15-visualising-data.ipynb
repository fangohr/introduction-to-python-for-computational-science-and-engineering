    "The submodule `matplotlib.pyplot` provides an object oriented interface to the plotting library. Many of the examples in the matplotlib documentation follow the import convention to import `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` and `numpy` as `np`. It is of course entirely the user’s decision whether to import the `numpy` library under the name `np` (as often done in matplotlib examples) or `N` as occasionally done in this text (and in the early days when the predecessor of numpy was called “Numeric”) or any other name you like. Similarly, it is a matter of taste whether the plotting submodule (`matplotlib.pyplot`) is imported as `plt` as is done in the matplotlib documentation or `plot` (which could be argued is slightly clearer) etc."

    "A small but powerful Python library is pyvtk available at https://github.com/pearu/pyvtk. This allows to create vtk files from Python data structures very easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a finite element mesh or a finite difference data set in Python, one can use pyvtk to write such data into files, and then use one of the visualisation applications listed above to load the vtk files and to display and investigate them."
