It is written in Perl. There is also a related program called cowthink, with cows with thought bubbles rather than speech bubbles. .cow files for cowsay exist which are able to produce different variants of \"cows\", with different kinds of \"eyes\", and so forth. It is sometimes used on IRC, desktop screenshots, and in software documentation. It is more or less a joke within hacker culture, but has been around long enough that its use is rather widespread. In 2007, it was highlighted as a Debian package of the day.\r\n"

Together with the community-run [conda-forge](http://conda-forge.org) project, there is a multitude of packages available.
