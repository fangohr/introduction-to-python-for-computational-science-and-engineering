    "When you open a notebook, you will find that you can move a highlighted block (with a blue line at the left) with the cursor keys to move up and down. This block highlights a *cell*. (You can also use the mouse to select a cell.) This is called the [Command mode](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html#Command-mode).\n",

(You may not notice if it just updates output that was displayed before, in particular if the new output is the same as the old output.)\n",

You have now entered the [Editing mode](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html#Edit-mode), and the content of the cell can be edited. If you have completed your changes, and you want to execute them, use the `Shift+ENTER` short cut.\n",

    "If you use this text book interactively on the mybinder service, then you have been given a temporary resource in the cloud to execute the code examples. The changes you have made to the notebook *will be lost* when your session ends (which is when you close the window, or the patience of the service has expired). Thus, the interactive exploration of the notebooks is good to help learn Python, computing and data science, but you should not attempt to write any code in these notebooks that you want to re-use the next day or later."
