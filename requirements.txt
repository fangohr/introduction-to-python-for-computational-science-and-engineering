# The required packages are listed here:

#nbconvert
#nbformat
#bookbook
#matplotlib
#notebook
#nbval
#numpy
#pandas
#pytest
#seaborn
#scipy
#sympy

# However,
#
# at the moment (June 2019), there is a problem with generating
# the pdf file
# see https://travis-ci.org/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/builds/536371629#L3274
#
# This has probably to do with work in nbconvert:
#
# https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/947
# https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/1053
#
#
# As a quick fix, I went back to the set of versions that worked okay
# in a previous build, and required exactly those as before:

# This works.
#
# For now. Should test if we can run from the master of each
# of the packages again soon (in a new merge request).
#
# Thanks to Thomas Kluyver for pointing me to the nbconvert issues.


# Addition 5 August 2019:
# When we can go back to the most current libraries, we will have to re-run
# (at least) these notebooks:
#
# 	modified:   01-introduction.ipynb
# 	modified:   12-symbolic-computation.ipynb
# 	modified:   14-numpy.ipynb
# 	modified:   15-visualising-data.ipynb
# 	modified:   16-scipy.ipynb
#
# They had to be re-run to make the nbval tests pass with the fixed library
# versions.
